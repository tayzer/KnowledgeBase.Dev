## 🎯 TL;DR / Quick Reference

**Definition:** CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates read and write models. Mediator (e.g., MediatR) centralizes sending commands/queries to handlers.

**When to use:**
- Complex domains with different read/write optimization needs.
- When you need clear separation for scaling or security.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ **Commands mutate state; Queries return data.**
- ✅ **Handlers** keep business logic isolated per operation.
- ⚡ **MediatR** reduces tight coupling between callers and handlers.

**Code Snippet:**
```csharp
public record CreateOrderCommand(OrderDto Order) : IRequest<int>;
public class CreateOrderHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateOrderCommand,int> { /* handle */ }
```

**Gotchas:**
- ⚠️ **Complexity:** Adds more types and indirection—may be overkill for simple apps.
- ⚠️ **Transactions:** Coordinate transactions across handlers carefully.

## 📚 Deep Dive

### Conceptual Foundation
CQRS improves clarity by modeling commands and queries differently. The read model can be denormalized and optimized for queries, while the write model focuses on consistency.

### Implementation Patterns
- Use separate DTOs for commands and queries.
- For read scaling, consider maintaining a read-database (projections) updated via events.

### Mediator Benefits
- Decouples callers from handlers; simplifies cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation) via pipeline behaviors.
