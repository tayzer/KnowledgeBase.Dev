## Creational
These deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling this object creation.
### Examples:
- [[Singleton]]
- [[Builder]]
- [[Prototype]]
- [[Factory Method]]
- [[Abstract Factory]]
## Structural
These concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
### Examples
- [[Adapter]]
- [[Bridge]]
- [[Composite]]
- [[Decorator]]
- [[Facade]]
- [[Flyweight]]
- [[Proxy]]
## Behavioural
These are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They handle object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities.
### Examples
- [[Interpreter]]
- [[Template Method]]
- [[Chain of Responsibility]]
- [[Command]]
- [[Iterator]]
- [[Mediator]]
- [[Memento]]
- [[Observer]]
- [[State]]
- [[Strategy]]
- [[Visitor]]
- [[Operation Result]]
