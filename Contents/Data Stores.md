### Overview
A brief introduction to what data stores are, their general purpose, and how they're relevant to the current context or system.
### Types of Data Stores
#### Relational Databases
- **Brief**: Relational databases are a type of database that organizes data into tables which can be linked—or related—based on data common to each. This type of database uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often used for complex querying, transaction processing, and handling large amounts of data, relational databases are a staple in both large and small applications across various industries.
- **Common Examples**: 
	- [[MySQL]]: An open-source relational database system known for its speed and reliability, widely used for many small to medium-sized applications.
	- [[PostgreSQL]]: An open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language. Known for its features, robustness, and scalability.
	- [[Oracle]]: A proprietary multi-model database management system known for its scalability, reliability, and security features, commonly used in large enterprises and critical systems.
- **Pros**: 
	- ACID Compliance: Ensures reliability in every transaction, maintaining data integrity and handling multiple transactions even during system failures.
	- Complex Queries: Advanced querying capabilities due to structured schema and SQL (Structured Query Language).
	- Data Integrity: High data integrity due to strong, schema-based data model, and relationships enforced between tables.
	- Security: Mature and robust security features such as encryption, user authentication, and access controls.
- **Cons**: 
	- Scalability: While they can be scaled vertically (more powerful servers), they often struggle with horizontal scaling (more servers), which is challenging and expensive.
	- Rigid Schema: Altering the schema can be complex and disruptive once the database is operational, making it less flexible for certain types of applications.
	- Complex Management: High management overhead; requires seasoned database administrators, especially for larger systems.
- **Use Case Suitability**: 
	- Transactional Systems: Ideal for applications requiring atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) transactions, such as financial systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and e-commerce platforms.
	- Data Integrity Requirements: Critical when the integrity of data is a top priority, such as in medical, financial, or enterprise applications where consistency of data is crucial.
	- Complex Querying: Suitable for environments where complex queries are common, and precise, structured queries are required to extract data.
#### NoSQL Databases
- **Brief**: NoSQL databases, or "Not Only SQL" databases, are non-tabular databases that allow for the storage and retrieval of data in formats other than the traditional rows and columns found in relational databases. They are particularly useful for working with large sets of distributed data. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model, such as document, key-value, wide-column, and graph formats, each offering unique mechanisms for storage and retrieval.
- **Common Examples**: 
	- [[MongoDB]]: A popular open-source document-oriented database known for its flexibility and scalability.
	- [[Cassandra]]: A wide-column store designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.
	- [[Redis]]: An in-memory key-value store known for its speed, used as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.
- **Pros**: 
	- Schema Flexibility: NoSQL databases typically have "schema-less" designs, offering flexibility in data representation.
	- Horizontal Scaling: They are designed for horizontal scaling, spreading the load across more servers for better performance and throughput.
	- High Performance: Optimized for specific data models (e.g., key-value, document) that can lead to higher performance for certain types of applications.
	- Handling Big Data: Efficient in handling large volumes of diverse data, often used in "big data" applications.
- **Cons**: 
	- Eventual Consistency: Many NoSQL systems sacrifice immediate consistency (ACID properties) for availability and partition tolerance, leading to "eventual consistency."
	- Support and Management: Less mature, fewer tools, and less experienced personnel compared to traditional SQL databases.
	- Complex Transactions: Not all NoSQL databases support ACID transactions; multi-document or multi-record transactions can be complex to handle.
	- Querying Limitations: Lack of a standardized query language like SQL can lead to limitations in querying capabilities, depending on the database type.
- **Use Case Suitability**: 
	- Big Data Applications: Ideal for managing large, evolving datasets with semi-structured or unstructured data.
	- Real-time Applications: Efficient for real-time data processing and management, such as in gaming, advertising technologies, or live content streaming.
	- Scalable Systems: Suitable for systems that require automatic scaling or have rapidly changing schemas, common in e-commerce, social media platforms, and IoT applications.
#### Data Warehouses
- **Brief**: Data warehouses are centralized repositories that store integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They are specially designed for query and analysis rather than transaction processing. Data warehouses are used to consolidate large volumes of data for business intelligence and analytics, enabling businesses to derive insights from their data to make informed decisions.
- **Common Examples**: 
	- [[Amazon Redshift]]: A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud that forms part of the larger cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services.
	- [[Google BigQuery]]: A web service from Google that is used for handling and analyzing big data. It is part of the Google Cloud Platform.
	- [[Snowflake]]: A cloud-based data-warehousing company that provides a data warehouse-as-a-service designed for the cloud.
- **Pros**: 
	- Optimized for Read-Heavy Operations: Data warehouses are specifically structured for complex queries and analysis, which are read-heavy operations.
	- Data Recovery and Durability: High data durability and built-in mechanisms for disaster recovery.
	- Historical Data Storage: They allow for the storage of historical data, enabling comparisons over time for trend analysis.
	- Integrating Data Sources: Capable of handling data from multiple sources, providing a unified platform for business intelligence.
- **Cons**: 
	- Not Ideal for Transactional Processes: Data warehouses are not suitable for real-time, transactional processing.
	- Cost: Can be expensive to set up, maintain, and manage, especially for small businesses.
	- Complexity: Requires significant setup, maintenance, and skilled personnel.
	- Data Latency: Due to the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, there may be latency in data availability.
- **Use Case Suitability**: 
	- Business Intelligence: Best suited for business intelligence applications where complex querying and analysis are required.
	- Data Analytics: Used for running analytics where large volumes of historical data are queried for business insights.
	- Reporting: Ideal for situations where businesses need to create complex reports and data visualizations.
