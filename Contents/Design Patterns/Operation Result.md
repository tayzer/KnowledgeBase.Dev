## Intent
The primary goal of the Operation Result pattern is to provide a mechanism that clearly communicates the outcome of an operation, encapsulating both success and error information in a manner that's easy to understand, manage, and decode at various levels of the software.
## Also Known As
Result, Command Result, Method Result
## Problem
Traditional methods of error handling, like exceptions, can be non-intuitive and often lead to convoluted control flows, making it difficult to understand the path of execution, particularly when operations can fail for non-exceptional reasons. There's a need for a uniform way to represent the success or failure of an operation, potentially including relevant data on success, or error information on failure.
## Solution
The Operation Result pattern involves returning an object that encapsulates the result of an operation. This result object contains a status flag (indicating success or failure), an error message or collection of error messages if applicable, and optionally, the relevant data produced by the operation if it was successful.
## Applicability or When to Use
- When you need a consistent method of receiving detailed results from operations, including success status, error messages, and potentially any value returned.
- When operations are expected to fail frequently under normal circumstances, and using exceptions would clutter the normal control flow.
## Structure
![Diagram](link-to-your-operation-result-diagram)
The diagram typically shows the OperationResult class and how client code interacts with it.
## Participants
- **OperationResult**: A class that encapsulates the status of an operation, error messages, and optionally any value produced by the operation.
## Collaborations
- Client code initiates an operation and then inspects the OperationResult object to determine what happened during the operation.
## Consequences
- Improves the clarity of communication regarding operation outcomes.
- Helps avoid the overuse of exceptions for control flow by providing a more functional approach to error handling.
- Requires consumers to check the result object after every operation, which could lead to verbose code if not managed properly.
## Known Uses
- Validation processes where multiple points can fail and it's important to communicate all failures back to the caller.
- API development, where a standardized response structure is beneficial for the consumers to understand the result (especially for RESTful APIs).
## Related Patterns
- **Command Pattern**: Operation Result can be used as the return type for command objects to provide detailed info about what happened during the command's execution.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different strategies can return Operation Result objects to indicate the outcome of the algorithm that was applied.
